In formal terms, a **directed graph** is an ordered pair G = (V, A) where
    V is a set whose elements are called vertices, nodes, or points;
    A is a set of ordered pairs of vertices, called arrows, directed edges (sometimes simply edges with the corresponding set named E instead of A), directed arcs, or directed lines.

indegree: the number of head ends adjacent to a vertex is called the **indegree** of the vertex.
outdegree: the number of tail ends adjacent to a vertex is its **outdegree**.
